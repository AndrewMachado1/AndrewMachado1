# Hi, I'm Andrew Piemonte

I'm a full-stack developer and computer engineer with a founder mindset, passionate about turning complex ideas into fast, scalable software. I specialize in building AI-enhanced cloud-native applications and MVPs that prioritize speed, feedback loops, and long-term maintainability.

### What I Do

- **Build MVPs fast** — Iterate with real user feedback to validate ideas early
- **Design scalable architectures** — Cloud-native systems using AWS, containers, and serverless
- **Integrate AI features** — Token-optimized LLMs, prompt engineering, RAG pipelines
- **Own the full stack** — From React frontends to FastAPI backends, deployed with CI/CD
- **Think like a founder** — Every project is treated like a product: speed + UX + strategy

### Tech Stack & Tools

**Cloud / DevOps**  
AWS (Lambda, EKS, S3, Bedrock), Terraform, CDK, GitHub Actions, Docker, Helm, Kubernetes

**Backend**  
Python, FastAPI, Node.js, Postgres, REST APIs, OpenAPI, async task systems

**Frontend**  
React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Figma, Locofy, responsive design principles

**AI / LLM**  
Prompt engineering, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), OpenAI, Bedrock, token optimization

**Product & Strategy**  
Startup architecture, lean MVPs, user feedback loops, modular system design, SaaS pricing strategy

### Core Values

- **Speed with discipline** — Move fast but write clean, well-documented code
- **Founder-first thinking** — Every feature ties to real user value
- **Clarity over complexity** — Simple, composable, and maintainable solutions
- **Scalability from day one** — Cloud-native patterns to grow with your product

### Currently Building

- An AI-enhanced AppSec platform with DAST + LLM integration (FastAPI + Bedrock + OWASP)
- A student platform to give undergrads full control over their academic and career planning (React + custom schema + recommendation engine)
